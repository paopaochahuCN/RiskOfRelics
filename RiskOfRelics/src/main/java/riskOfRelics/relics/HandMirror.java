         * Having only the JSON files for translation rather than 15 different instances of "Dexterity" in some random cards is A LOT easier.
         *
         * 2. You don't have a centralised file for all strings for easy proof-reading. If you ever want to change a string
         * you don't have to go through all your files individually/pray that a mass-replace doesn't screw something up.
         *
         * 3. Without hardcoded strings, editing a string doesn't require a compile, saving you time (unless you clean+package).
